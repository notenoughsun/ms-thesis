We perform this research to create an indoor positioning system with special features. The objective of this research is to develop all algorithms needed to obtain these features. The specified context states that no GPS data are available at hand, which makes the use of common navigation services impossible.

For human navigation in buildings the common approach is to use smartphones as a tracking device. We add a magnetic sensor to this model. We develop the algorithms magnetometer data fusion and mapping with given sensor. \\
We develop a simulation tool for estimation the accuracy of algorithm performance and visualization purposes. We generate all observations with observation and motion model. Using probabilistic approach with particle filter we reconstruct true map and poses from noisy input data. \\
We propose a recursive map reconstruction procedure from noisy filtered data based on graph matching and hierarchical clustering.

We support the choice of technology and algorithm specifications with a technological roadmap.

The innovation of this research is in ability to provide same navigation services with less information and in more natural way, which means also the reduced cost of the system overall.
