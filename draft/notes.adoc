We have a Markov process. After processing to the point with high confidence we may recalculate all previous positions - close loop.

Consider the process is Markovian.

\section{Transition model definition}

Copied all from \cite{articleXia}:

With  the  development  of  microelectromechanical  systems(MEMS),  a  few  MEMS-based  sensors  have  been  built  and
incorporated  into  smartphones:  accelerometers,  gyroscopes,magnetometers,  etc.  These  sensors  can  be  used  to  provide information  on  the  user’s  actions.  Pedestrian  dead  reckon-ing  (PDR)  [10]  is  a  relative  navigation  technique  that  uses these sensors.

we propose a PDR-based  indoor positioningmethod  that  integrates  RSSI  with  indoor  environment  mapconstraints by using particle filters.

PDR-based indoor positioning can be expressed by the following equations

// asciimath:[]

latexmath:[
\begin{equation}
    X_k = \
    \begin{bmatrix} 
        x_{t-1} \\
        y_{t-1} 
    \end{bmatrix} = \
    \begin{bmatrix} 
        x_{t-1} &+ l_k \sin(\theta_t) \\
        y_{t-1} &+ l_k \cos(\theta_t) 
    \end{bmatrix} + \
    \begin{bmatrix} 
        \delta_{x} \\
        \delta_{y} 
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
]

The orientation  updates is independent from $X_k$ updates, depends on accelerometer and gyro, same model.

Step   Detection:Android   mobile   phones   have   two kinds  of  sensors  to  monitor  steps:  step  counters  and  step detectors [25]. 

Peak detection is used in this paper for step detection

nonlinear step length estimation model based on statistics proposed by Weinberg [27]

// latexmath:[
// ]

\begin{equation}
// s_z = k \sqrt{a}
step_{size} = k \sqrt ^4{a_{z max} - a_{z min}}
\end{equation}


The Android system computes orientation angles by using the  device’s  geomagnetic  sensors  in  combination  with  its accelerometers   [25].   Using   these   two   hardware   sensors,the  system  provides  data  for  the  following  three  orientation angles

The  device is NOT  assumed to  be pointing in the heading direction. Need to apply additional space transformation.

\subsection{RSSI methode}

Usual path-loss model:

\begin{equation}
    PL(d) = PL(d0) + 10 \alpha \log{d / d_0} + \omega = 
    PL(d0) + 10 \alpha \log{d / d_0} + N(0, \sigma^2_{\omega})
\end{equation}



where $d$ represents the Euclidean distance between the anchor node  and  the  receiver,d0represents  a  specified  distance,PL(d)and PL(d0)represent the RSSI at $d$ and $d_0$, respectively(in  dBm),  andαrepresents the  path  loss  exponent, which  is closely related to the ambient environment;ωis a zero-mean Gaussian distribution variable with variance $\sigma^2_{\omega}$.

The inverse function: 
\begin{equation}
    d_i = d_0 \cdot 10 \frac{PL(d_i) - PL(d_0)}{10\alpha}
\end{equation}

Landmark model:

\begin{align}
    f_i(x, y) &= d_i - \sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2} \\
    min(x, y) &= min \sum_{i=1}^{m}[f_i(x, y)]^2, m \ge 3.
\end{align}

In paper author transform this to linear system, 

\begin{align}
    AZ & = b \\
    A &= \begin{bmatrix} 
        1 - 2 x_1 - 2 y_1 \\
        ... \\
        1 - 2 x_m - 2 y_m
    \end{bmatrix} \\
    Z &= \begin{bmatrix} 
        x^2 + y^2 \\
        x \\
        y
    \end{bmatrix} \\
    b &= \begin{bmatrix} 
        d_1^2 - x_1^2 - y_2^2\\
        ...\\
        ...
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

We have to check it

Good alternative was proposed in \cite{} to bound region by min and max RSSI according to its variance - linear system.

\subsection{Processing}

Update step, prediction, correction
State Estimation


Resample:In  this  step,  importance  resampling  [20]  isused to obtain a new particle set

some papers prove importance resampling can't be applied for this task because pf noise.
% observation equation:

\section{Crasy Idea}

There is some similarity in video compressing process

We strore gradients of changing signal measurements, we apply searching procedure to have a smooth measurements.

We have a convex magnetic field and a trajectory, 
the task is to find similar trajectrory with highest correlation to measurements.

Regression, approximation, pattern matching, Convolutions.

Gradients, blockmatching

Different approaches in papers, play on a toy model.

== impossible problem

Even though modern UAVs havehigh-quality multispectral imaging capabilities, the processing of these images isstill a challenging task for machine vision algorithms due to the complex structureof plants’ topology and broad variety types of background. Partially this problemcan be solved by using Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) for semanticsegmentation. However, due to the complexity of the proposed problem, existing al-gorithms cannot adequately perform semantic segmentation of diverse plants in fieldconditions. Furthermore, there is still a problem with optimizing high-performancecomputational algorithms for mobile platforms, and resolving this new fundamentalapproach should be investigated and implemented.

== the idea

compare image segmentation + fitting + image merging
with relocalization

"G.D. Evangelidis, E.Z. Psarakis, Parametric Image Alignment using Enhanced Correlation Coefficient Maximization", IEEE Trans. on PAMI, vol. 30, no. 10, 2008. ECC algorithm is a direct (gradient-based) image registration algorithm. Due to gradient information, it achieves high accuracy in parameter estimation (i.e. subpixel accuracy). Its performance is invariant to global illumination changes in images since it considers the correlation coefficient (zero-mean normalized cross correlation) as an objective function.

Feature selection is a necessary step which consists of selecting a subset of relevant data features with higher quality information within the original feature set to represent the nature  of  the  data. The  objectiveof  feature  selectionis  to determinethe  most informative and influential features used torecognize and representhuman walking behavior toprovide accurate step prediction. Using   the   kinematic   physical   features,   derived   from   the measurement parameters of human motion,the statistical features and overall feature space is enhanced with a broad reach ofrepresentative metrics[14]. Redundancy of data tends to incorrectly model the systems behavior and leads to loss of accuracy by incorrect predictions.For  this  reason,  it  was  desirable  to  include many  varyingderived  physical  inertial components  of  the  measured  foot  IMU  data,derivedstatistical  metrics and  representativeglobal window features such as overall time and distance in attempt to recognize the model’s behavior as accurately as possible.Traditionally, in human gait analysis, features such as mean, variance, correlation, and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)coefficients computed from motion measurement sensorsare depended on for recognition[3].


27profound  ability  to  learn  incrementally.  The  KNN  method  adapts  well  to  learning  and predicting data streams, where it can determine the closest matched instance of new data. It  performs exceptionally  well  at  observing  and  classifying  new  and  complex  instancesof data,  compared  to  other  supervised  learning  methods.  This  makes  the  KNN  algorithm  a highly desired method for this work

A short road path to implement a positioning system is as
follows

. Collect the available measurements in Table 2.
. Compute the static CRB using (3) or using (4a) in the Gaussian case.
. Compare this to the FCC requirements in Table 1.
. If these are not satisfied, continue with step 5. Otherwise, evaluate algorithms based on one of the criteria in Table 3 using one of the algorithms in Table 4. If these algorithms do not yield a satisfactory result, continue with step 5.
. Select a motion model in Table 7.
. Compare the CRB to the FCC requirements in Table 8.
. If these are satisfied, try to find an algorithm in Table 9
that gives satisfactory result. If this fails, try to change the
system configuration to obtain better measurements, or
equip the MS with more sensors.
