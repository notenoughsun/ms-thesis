Indoor navigation solutions are a wide range of products and services. While "indoor routing" functionality that guides people through the buildings is important, there are lots of services that support it, such as content management system, mobile and web applications, indoor and outdoor localization, social networks, data analytics, and many others.
//
// Why do we need indoor navigation and positioning? This is because of the convenience of global Geo-services, and because of GPS reception problems inside buildings.
//
// An understandable example of such kind of products is Google Maps, which are scaled to work inside the buildings.

// The situation is much more complicated.
Indoor positioning systems is a growing industry with hundreds of applications.
// The market for indoor positioning applications is multi segmented.
Different applications from security applications and assets tracking in business and manufacturing to the proximity advertising in retail. From fully protected to broadcast solutions, from cheap high range proximity to high precision solutions in robotics.

Different applications have different technologies behind it. Over 15-20 different working technologies are known. Only 3 of them are widely used now (WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, Image-Based).

to establish the nature of the relationship between information space

graph-based representation of the geographic environment - This step can be
thought of as building a graph-based equivalent of a Voronoi diagram. 
// Indeed, the term
// “graph Voronoi diagram” is coined and formally defined in [5].
If schema matching is performed manually, it is a time consuming process and
therefore it should be automated as much as possible. For this purpose, [7] have
built up a library of different match algorithms (called “matchers”). For example,
they use
Hybrid matchers: Matching operations which are using a fixed combination of
matchers to improve the match result, e.g. a combination of n-gram and edit dis-
tance or a combination of name and data type matching, etc.

Internal Cardinal Direction (ICD) relations can be considered as the
refinement to the contains/within topological relation. It is widely used to de-
scribe the position of an object in a region. In this paper, three ICD models with
varying degrees of details are presented -- ICD-5, ICD-9 and ICD-13.

internal cardinal direction (ICD) relations which
can be applied to refine the spatial survey knowledge when two objects have con-
tains/within topological relations.
