// Сделайте его боле компактным, сейчас опять кажется, что вы хотите решить очень много разных задач.
// Важно сделать более четкое statement, что данная работа посвящена разработкам алгоритмов для решения такой-то важной задачи.
// И важно четко сформулировать, что нам даст разработка софта, и как это продвинет данную область вперед.
// Лучше написать меньше, но более четко.

// Indoor local positioning system for smartphones with infrastructure-free integration.

// The project statement is::
// "Development of software system for specific chosen user case."
// We aim to develop a system that is not just any, but a system with specific properties.

// We aim to create an indoor navigation system.
// For that, we need to have a set of algorithms for localization, mapping, and other practical tasks.

We want to create a framework for collecting database of fingerprints (magnetic, WiFi, BLE and others).

Because the approach is SLAM, it may be considered from both sides: as a mapping tool and as a localization product. We have to satisfy criteria for both of them.

.Criteria for the system proposed:
* can be implemented locally
* no special hardware for operation
* positioning accuracy enough for operation (1-2m depending on requirements)
* cost, complexity, accuracy, time of development

// We evaluate technologies on several important criteria: cost, complexity, accuracy, time of development.
// With this, we test hypotheses of what technology is more suitable to build the navigation system.

// Based on previous research, we have chosen magnetic field technology for this project.

.Hypotheses:
. Current systems on the market (WiFi, BLE) are not suitable for standalone applications in common use-case.
. Competitive technology of magnetic field navigation may be implemented and fine-tuned for several common use-cases.



// We define the scope of a project::
// Specific focus on technology and common applications. Fine-tuning of magnetic technology according to hypotheses 1 and 2.


// Development of software system for indoor location services applications, with system properties (price, accuracy, features) being optimized for a specific user-case.

// .Specific objectives:


// .Specific AIMs for the project
