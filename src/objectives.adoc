The project statement is:: "Development of software system for specific chosen user case."
We aim to develop a system that is not just any, but a system with specific properties.

We aim to create an indoor navigation system.
For that, we need to have a set of algorithms for localization, mapping, and other practical tasks.

Before we write the code of a project, we do research on what technology we have to develop.

We evaluate technologies on several important criteria: cost, complexity, accuracy, time of development.
With this, we test hypotheses of what technology is more suitable to build the navigation system.

Based on previous research, we have chosen magnetic field technology for this project.

The main hypothesis is:: Current systems on the market (WiFi, BLE) are not suitable for standalone applications in common use-case.

The second hypothesis:: Competitive technology of magnetic field navigation is perspective. This technology may be implemented and fine-tuned for several common use-cases.

We define the scope of a project::
Specific focus on technology and common applications. Fine-tuning of magnetic technology according to hypotheses 1 and 2.
