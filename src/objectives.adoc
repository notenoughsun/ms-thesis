The project statement is:: "Development of software system for specific chosen user case."
We aim to develop system that is not just any, but a system with specific properties.

We aim to create an indoor navigation system.
For that we need to have a set of algorithms for localization, mapping and other practical tasks.

Before we write the code of a project, we do research of what technology we have to develop.

We valuate technologies on several important criterias: cost, complexity, accuracy, time of development.
With this, we test hypoteses of what technology is more suitable to build the navigation system.

Based on previous research, we have chosen magnetic field technology for this project.

The main hypotese is:: Current systems on the market (WiFi, BLE) are not suitable for standalone application in common usecase.

The second hypotese:: Competitive technology of magnetic field navigation is perspective. This technology may be implemented and fine-tuned for several common usecases.

We define the scope of a project::
Specific focus on technology and common applications. Fine tuning of magnetic technology according to hypoteses 1 and 2.
