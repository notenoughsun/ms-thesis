== Working topic 
Enchancements of smartphone-based magnetic fingerprinting and dead reckoning localization technique for infrustructure free localization indoors.

=== Background and problem statement
// that describes the subject matter in terms of its importance and potential for action. Describe the connection between research and innovation. Clarify the reasons for the choice of the thesis project topic. 

The problem:: Development of software system for indoor location services applications, with system properties (price, accuracy, features) being optimized for specific chosen user case.

// indoor localization system with no additional hardware - infrustructure free 

Indoor navigation is a market with no real working solution. Various companies are trying to provide localization services indoors, but they can't reach GPS level properties. The main problems in this area are the price and scalability of the whole system.
For example, in several locations this system are working and installed - airports, railway stations, hospitals. However for smaller applications there is also a need of this technologies, but the price and the complexity of the whole system is too high for worldwide implementation.

Several companies and researches are now developing the infrastructure free approaches. This means that the system works without any additional hardware installed "on-stage". 
Usually, there is a transmitter and receiver needed for communication and localization of people. On human side there is always a smartphone or any tracking device, sometimes only a passive mark such as RFID or NFC. On the facility side there may be different complex architectures of equipment. Usually WiFi transmitters (office facilities), RFID antennas (in marketplaces) and other special devices. The alternative of having no additional equipment on facilities side is the topic of this research.

The infrastructure-free approach however is not stable, the final accuracy changes from many factors. 
//The so-called level of readiness of technology is lower than competing technologies.

//Enchancements of smartphone-based magnetic fingerprinting and  localization technique for infrustructure free localization indoors.

.The reasons for the choice of the thesis project topic:
* it is possible to create and deliver working system in less than one year
* all technologies on the market have similar level of accuracy >> we focus on improving system to be universal and stable
* we have researched the market for this technology and product, we see the oppurtunity to create startup and deliver services based on this technology after this product is done
