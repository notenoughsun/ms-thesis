.There are several enhancements of technology we want to test:
* Relocalization technique (air imaging approach) >> improve mapping
* Kalman filters for the dead reckoning (extended Kalman filter) >> improve stability
* Bayesian methods of user coordinate prediction >> improve localization
* Smartphone-based magnetic fingerprinting (usual approach) >> infrastructure-free navigation system

We use data of Microsoft competition as a starting reference (D.  Lymberopoulos,  J.  Liu,  X.  Yang,  R.  Choudhury, V.  Handziski,  S.  Sen,  F.  Lemic,  J. Buesch,  Z. Jiang, H. Zou, H. Jiang, C. Zhang, A. Ashok, C. Xu, P. Lazik, N.  Rajagopal,  A.  Rowe,  A.  Ghose,  N.  Ahmed,  and P.  Hevesi,  “A realistic evaluation and comparison of indoor location technologies: Experiences and lessons learned,” 04 2015.). 

In the table (not presented), we have a time of development and resulting accuracy for the different technology choices of different teams participated.
// \ref{tab:my-competition}
We may use these dependencies to understand, what time is needed to achieve each level of accuracy for different combinations of technologies.


We choose the best performance in technologies 
// \ref{tab:best-tech} 
by multiplication of all of parameters.
Performance = 1 / (development time * accuracy). The selected technologies are presented in the table below.
