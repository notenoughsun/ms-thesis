// First we define current state of the art, we build the modelfor existing technologies, analyze products on the market, listkey players and IP owners, create Pareto frontier. This part isintended  to  make  a  visible  and  understandable  landscape  ofthis technology segment.
// // To develop the right product, we first have to identify its figures of merit. 
// // When the figures of merits stated, we have to choose the right technology. First we develop the framework for technology choise. 

// // We do a theoretical research, from which we decide on a technology and methods. This we call a roadmap, becase it gives us some prior assumptions of next series of steps to be done.

// .The roadmap:
// * show the evolution of IPS technology
// ** repeat the research of indoor positioning systems review (example, one of the most useful for now) or other IPS publicaions
// ** visualize IPS usage and work principles (different technologies, connections, FOMs, applications)
// * create financial and technical models for different IPS technologies
// * calculate the possible effect of merging different technologies for different applications
// ** calculate in FOMs / prices (novelty)
// * connect different technologies into single model (where possible)
// * create system / strategy for optimal* technology choice decision
// ** map / compare existing products and trends over defined figures of merit

.Preparation landscape research
First we define current state of the art, we build the model for existing technologies, analyze products on the market, list key players and IP owners, create Pareto frontier. This part is intended to make a visible and understandable landscape of this technology segment.

// A statement of the methodology for the thesis project that defines specific design of the procedures, data collection, analysis, and (or) interpretation. Illustrate how the method you have chosen best allows you to fulfill the purpose of the thesis project.

.Procedures list
* collection of magnetic fingerprints dataset with smartphone sensors: Gyroscope, compass, IMU.
* development of a model for localization using this dataset
* experiments using model, estimation of accuracy
* implementation of possible techniques, benchmarking
* fine-tuning of perspective technique
* comparison to other products on the market, interpretation of results
