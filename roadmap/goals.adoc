Scope
	
show the evolution of IPS technology, visualize IPS usage and work principles (different technologies, connections, FOMs, applications)
	

Tech strategy vision

create strategy for an optimal* technology choice decision, repeat existing roadmaps progress, use gathered data for technology choice. Most products are services, the vision should be service focused (e.g. connection of existing technologies)
	

Timeline
	
analyze existing roadmaps and publications for data.
Future prediction on the technological side can’t be done precisely, working on this.

	

Roadmap model in OPM
	
current researches doesn’t provide models for product-technology choice, possible to cover this point This part connected with positioning are most important for the IPS roadmap
	

Figures of Merit
	
current figures of merit used in different publications may not be used for financial valuation
	
understand simple & proven FOMs with open data, build an OPM above them
	

Positioning

positioning can be developed either for the specific technology or for the whole IPS. the focus will depend on the available data. The positioning is supposed to be used as a proof for the roadmap strategy choice and for visualization of technology landscape. The least feasible landscape is needed.

Technical Feasibility using System Model

Possible application is to use in Financial Valuation models.
	

Financial Valuation
	
The idea is to use this roadmap to build a tool for Financial valuation of usage different technologies in IPS.

Important part. Future goal is what has been shown on
	
Risks and Opportunities	
	this part is a part of a project of indoor navigation, customer's survey are done to understand the market needs and drivers. Mb it can't be applied for the roadmap. Usual verification of roadmap has to be done during the work. Instead of Delphi, better compare to other publications if possible.
