2) Many problems accept discretization. Not all of them.

from l02 planning

we apply the discretisation to our problem, and transform the global search task, to local graph search problem. The problem becomes much similar to HMC solutions and realisations.


The objective is to find a feasible solution to slam and planning problems.
Why does the term feasible is applied here? We have to first define, what is infeasible solution, and which system is inappropriate for usage.

Considering the probabilistic approach, once we have some uncertaity in data, we need a way to reduce this uncertainty. So, the only requirement for the system, is that the covariance in localization problem can be decreased.

In our implementation, we perform integration of IMU data. The uncertainty increases quadratically. 

// our method
After a series of integration steps, we have a new pose. The uncertainty can be decreased only after adding new information on human or location. The information we have are sensor measurements, building map, IMU data.
For the extension of current aproach we may consider pose prediction methods, special approach of human step detection and different sesnor fusion models.
Here we don't consider this refinements and focus on localization and mapping method only for a given sensor model. 

// We want to estimate, how spatial magnetic field data can be utilized without signal of other sensors. We know that 
The dead-reckoning is the localization or pose update when the sensor data are not available. In common indoor localization sistem , as in []
traditional sensors are []
we model the localization with loosy signal connection of WiFi and BLE, we estimate how the spatial data of magnetic field and IMU PDR can increase the localization accuracy. 
// TODO: need an experimant here

Given the proof that the spatial information of magnetic field has a significan effect for traditional PDR, we focus on this technology.

We have examples of products that are based mostly on magnetics field
// list products and papers

There is no information of how the magnetic data can be collected in absence of precise location. We searched for a possible solutions to this task.

First, the task is to find a precise location which is usually called ground truth for training the system, creating the map of the location, for estimatimation of the algorithm performance.
